# 90-Days-Challenge

Just embark on a 90-day journey to sharpen my data analysis skills! Each day, I will work on data analysis projects using SQL, Python, RStudio, and Business Intelligence tools like Power BI and Tableau. This challenge aims to enhance my proficiency in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling while solving real-world problems across diverse datasets. Join me as I document my progress and share insights from this intensive learning experience!
